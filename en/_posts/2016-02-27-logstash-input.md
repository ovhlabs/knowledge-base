"All you have to know about the Logstash Input on PaaS Logs" is your main source of information about deploying a Logstash input on PaaS Logs. Logstash is a software developed by Elastic and allows you to send messages from different inputs to different type of output using different codec while processing them and transforming them in the process.
You can learn a lot more about it on [the official website](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash). We believe that it is a powerful tool that you would love to use with PaaS Logs. Yes, on PaaS Logs you can deploy your personal Logstash with your own configuration. That will allow you for example to send your data from many sources to one and only Logstash instead of configuring one on each of your host. You will find which plugins are supported, which ones are not and how to spawn a Logstash input on PaaS Logs.
