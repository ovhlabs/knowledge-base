"All you have to know about the Logstash Input on PaaS Logs" is your main source of information about deploying a Logstash input on PaaS Logs. Logstash is a software developed by Elastic and allows you to send messages from different inputs to different type of output using different codec while processing them and transforming them in the process.
You can learn a lot more about it on [the official website](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash). We believe that it is a powerful tool that you would love to use with PaaS Logs. Yes, on PaaS Logs you can deploy your personal Logstash with your own configuration. That will allow you for example to send your data from many sources to one and only Logstash instead of configuring one on each of your host. You will find which plugins are supported, which ones are not and how to spawn a Logstash input on PaaS Logs.

This is a rather long document but if you are already familiar with Logstash you can jump to the parts you're interested in :  

 - [What is Logstash](#logstash_101)
 - [How do I configure Logstash on PaaS Logs](#paas_config)
 - [What is special about our hosted Logstash ?](#additional)  

This is "All you have to know about the Logstash Input on PaaS Logs" !

#1 What is Logstash 
Logstash is mainly a processing pipeline of data that allows you to get or receive information from a lot of sources and transform them if necessary before sending them to different type of software. In a configuration file you have 3 main parts to configure it :
 
 - The Input part : This part details where your logs come from. Some inputs wait for logs and some inputs are able to fetch them from a database for example. 
 - The Filter part : This part details how Logstash should parse and transform your logs messages. 
 - The Output part : This part specifies in which format to send logs and where to send them. 

   Here is a small configuration file so you get an idea : 

```
#input
#The input part just launch tcp server that will listen on port 5000
#Each incoming line of log will be tagged as a syslog type. 
input {
     tcp {
        port => 4000
        type => syslog
    }
}

#Filter 
#The filter part applies a grok filter that will parse the message 
#It will also create new fields with information contained in the message.
filter {
 grok {
   match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGBASE}" }
  }

 date {
    match => [ "timestamp", "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" ]
    target => "timestamp"
    timezone => "Europe/Paris"
  }
}

#Output 
#The output part will then encode everything in a gelf format and send it to laas.runabove.com on the UDP GELF Input
#Note that it will also add our token in the process. 
output {
  gelf {
      host => "laas.runabove.com"
      port => 2202
      custom_fields => ['X-OVH-TOKEN', 'da819874-5562-4a5f-b34e-fa8e708e8f16']
  }
}
```

This is one example of configuration among others you can use in your own Logstash to send syslog type logs to PaaS Logs.
There is a lot of filter and plugin available in Logstash, and the list is growing !
For example by sending these kind of lines into this Logstash :

you will have the following result in your stream in Graylog :

![local_logstash_graylog](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/local_logstash_graylog.png)

So now let's suppose, you have a lot of hosts and you want to send all your syslog outputs to Logstash. One way to do it is to put one Logstash on one of your machine and send all the logs to this hosts. This will work but what happens if your host go down ? or is not fast enough ? Or if it is allergic to Java ? Don't worry the best part about PaaS Logs is that we can host your Logstash for you. We also allow you to configure the input and the filter as you wish and you can even define custom Groks. The next chapter will tell you how to do it !

<a name="paas_config">&nbsp;</a>

# Host a Logstash input on PaaS Logs.   
The Logstash Input comes with many advantages : 

 - The output part of the Logstash is automatically configured by us.
 - You have your own certificate to enable SSL. This certificate can be used for example to trust only the TCP Inputs of your Logstash. 
This certificate and its associated key can be found at the following paths :  `/etc/ssl/private/server.crt` for the cert and  `/etc/ssl/private/server.key` for the key. The CA used to create these inputs is at the following location `/etc/ssl/private/ca.crt`. You will find this SSL CA for reference at the end of this document. 
 - And finally, we ensure that your input is always up and running 24/7.

To host this input in the PaaS Logs, you will need to configure it in the PaaS Logs manager. Check the `Inputs` panel next to the Stream one and click on the '+' button. The Manager will then ask you to select your Engine : Select `Logstash 2.3` and put a elegant name and a wonderful description. Click on the blue floppy disk button and TA-DA, your input is created. 


![logstash_creation](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/logstash_creation.png)


The Engine won't allow you to start it if you do not configure it properly. So let's do it !

## Logstash Input configuration
Click on Configuration to display the Logstash Configuration Panel as follows : 


![logstash_creation](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/config_logstash_1.png)


There is 3 section in this pop-up :
 
 - The Input section where you put the Input part of your configuration file. 
 - The Filter section where you put the filter part. 
 - The grok patterns sections where you can create your own grok patterns.

If we take the configuration example above and if we enable the SSL encryption, we have that configuration for the Input Section : 


```
input {
     tcp {
        port => 4000
        type => syslog
        ssl_enable => true
        ssl_cert => "/etc/ssl/private/server.crt"
        ssl_key => "/etc/ssl/private/server.key"
        ssl_extra_chain_certs => ["/etc/ssl/private/ca.crt"]
    }
}
```

![logstash_creation](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/input_section.png)


As you can see, this is roughly the same configuration that before. The SSL configuration needs 4 extra parameters :
 
 - `ssl_enable`: that allows to enable SSL. Must be set to 'true'.  
 - `ssl_cert`: the location of the auto-generated server certificate.
 - `ssl_key`: the location of the associated key. 
 - `ssl_extra_chain_certs` : the array contains the path to the CA certificate.

All the inputs have preconfigured ssl certificates at the fixed locations used in the configuration above.
And for the filter part, you just have to copy and paste the previous configuration.  

![logstash_creation](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/filter_section.png)


The last section of the configuration is dedicated to custom Grok Filters. If you know about Grok, you can use this text area to create your own grok that you can use in the filter section above. It is useful for advanced usage of Logstash. Head to the end of the document to get some links that can help you use this functionality. 

You can then click on `Update Configuration` and your Logstash is configured !
You can always verify that your Logstash configuration is correct by using the `Test` button in the Inputs panel. This will launch a task, that will tell you if your configuration is valid. Check the screenshot below. 

![logstash_creation](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/test_success.png)


You really want to click on `Start` but are we there yet ? No, but we are almost there. 

Many inputs like the redis one for example, fetch their own data from various sources. But in the case of the TCP Input, you need to tell us which port you want to open in your Input. Moreover your input will have a public IP, you don't want anyone to mess up with it. Don't worry you can further secure you input by whitelisting only a few IP.

## Input Networking Configuration : 

To configure the Network for your input, please click on the Networking Button. 
In the pop up, you will be able to specify which port(s) you open and which IPs or Subnet you allow to join your input. Just add every entry by using the fields and by clicking `Add`. This little window will always remind you which ports are open and which IPs can access it : 


![network_input](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/network-input.png)

Click on `Update Configuration` and it's done. That's all for the Network Configuration.

You still want to click on `Start` I bet but are we there yet ? Not yet. Yes there is something that we have to do. We didn't configure our output section so How PaaS Logs will add the token in the output part ? 
It is simple, your Input just have to subscribe to your stream. Read on ! 


##Stream configuration

By clicking on `Subscription` button in the Input panel, you will pop an interface similar to the previous one. In this window you can just select your stream in the list and click on the button `Attach this stream`. Once attached, you can close it. 

![network_input](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/stream_sub.png)

The output will be automatically configured to add the right token. You don't have to send it with your logs, you don't even have to know it !
So now you can click on `Start` and deploy your input on PaaS Logs.

![input_start](/kb/images/2016-02-27-logstash-input/input_start.png)


##Input Hostname

Once your input is started, you will see in the panel an adress in the following format : 

`c002-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.in.laas.runabove.com`. 

This is the address of your inputs for LaaS. Send your logs to this address to have them processed by your input. Use for example the previous syslog Lines to test your inputs. 
If you head to Graylog, you will find your Logs in the attached Stream just as before.
