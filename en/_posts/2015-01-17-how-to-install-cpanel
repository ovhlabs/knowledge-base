To run cPanel on RunAbove need a new security group permissions.

# 1. Create a custom Security Group 

Go to the [OpenStack Horizon](https://cloud.runabove.com/horizon/), then go to _Access and Security_ panel and then click on _Create Security Group_ and fill the _Name_ and _Description_ fields.

# 3. Assign rules to instance
After you added the rules to security group, you must assign the security group to instance.

# 4. Enable root access
To install cPanel, need _root_ access, so if the instance already exist and was created with ssh key, login into instance using the ssh key and run the next commands:

```
sudo su
passwd
```
And insert the password for _root_ account.
