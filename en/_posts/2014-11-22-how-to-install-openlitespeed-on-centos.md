[OpenLiteSpeed](http://open.litespeedtech.com/) is a high-performance, lightweight, open source HTTP server. It has some awesome feature such as built in page caching, Web GUI for realtime stats, apache mod_rewrite compatibility and many more. 

[Phalcon](http://phalconphp.com/en/) is a web framework implemented as a C extension offering high performance and lower resource consumption.

Installing OpenLiteSpeed
===

In this step, I assume you already launch centOS instance. Log in via ssh to your instance and upgrade centOS package

~~~bash
sudo yum update
~~~

Add this OpenLiteSpeed repository if your centOS version is 6

~~~bash
sudo rpm -ivh http://rpms.litespeedtech.com/centos/litespeed-repo-1.1-1.el6.noarch.rpm
~~~

and this one for centOS version 7

~~~bash
rpm -ivh http://rpms.litespeedtech.com/centos/litespeed-repo-1.1-1.el7.noarch.rpm
~~~

Install OpenLiteSpeed

~~~bash
sudo yum install openlitespeed
~~~

It will install to latest stable release. Now run OpenLiteSpeed service by following this command

~~~bash
sudo /usr/local/lsws/bin/lswsctrl start
~~~

By default OpenLiteSpeed Web Admin listen on port `7080` and example website listen on `8088`. You have to open those port in RunAbove cloud panel.

Just fill field exactly same with picture above, it will allow all incoming connection to port `7080`. But if security is your concern You may limit source of incoming connection to certain CIDR. If you are done click add and repeat same process to allow port `8088`. Your rules should look like like this
