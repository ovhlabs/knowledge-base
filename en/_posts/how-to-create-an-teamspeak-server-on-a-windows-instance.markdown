Creating an TeamSpeak server is actually very simple, and if you follow this guide correctly
you'll be on your way to chatting with your fellow friends in no time!

--------------------------

First Step: Connecting to a windows server!
--------------------------
If you didn't guess already you'll need to connect to your RunAbove windows instance, simply remote desktop to it, if you don't know how to follow this guide [here](https://github.com/runabove/knowledge-base/blob/master/en/_posts/2014-05-16-how-to-create-a-windows-instance.markdown) and you'll also want to remotely connect to it so click [here](https://github.com/vladreinis/knowledge-base/blob/master/en/_posts/2014-05-20-how-to-configure-remote-desktop-on-windows-server.markdown) to find out afterwards; don't forget to thank VincentCasse for creating those wonderful articles.

Assuming you've connected already, you'll see probably and most likely Windows Desktop would appear:

Second Step: Downloading the TeamSpeak server.
--------------------------
Alright, we're logged; let's begin with the most important part, which is; you guessed it! Downloading the files.
You can download the files by clicking [here](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads).

Since this is a windows server you'll click Windows 64-bit or 32-bit if your system is 32-bit based.

Third Step: Extracting the files.
--------------------------
Okay, go to your downloads folder, and you should see a zip file named something like, "teamspeak3-server_winxx-x.x.xx.x.zip", let x = whatever number.

Okay double click on it, and open it as explorer, you should see a folder and inside there should be a bunch of files.
Simply drag and drop the main folder somewhere you like, for example I put it in my Documents folder.

Last Step: Launching you're wonderful new server.
--------------------------

Now just go inside the main folder, and just simply double click on the 'ts3server_winXX.exe', let X = number.
You'll then be prompted with a window with some codes, copy them somewhere safe!
