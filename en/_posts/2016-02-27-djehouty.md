Djehouty is intended to be a set of logging formatters and handlers to easily send log entries into PaaS Logs.

This package includes:

- for [GELF](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/gelf.html):
  - a TCP/TLS handler to send log entries over TCP with TLS support.
  - a formatter to convert logging record into GELF(1.1).

- for [LTSV](http://ltsv.org/):
  - a TCP/TLS handler to send log entries over TCP with TLS support.
  - a formatter to convert logging record into LTSV.
