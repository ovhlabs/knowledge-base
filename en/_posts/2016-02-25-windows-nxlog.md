At OVH, we love Microsoft products too. So it is important for us to provide you a way to send your Windows Logs to PaaS Logs. All you need is 15 minutes and one software : [NXLog](http://nxlog.co). NXLog is one of the leader of the log management tools. Its configuration is fairly simple and can get you started in a few minutes. 


For this tutorial you will need to have completed the following steps : 

  - [Activate the PaaS Logs lab and create an account.](/kb/en/logs/quick-start.html#account)
  - [To create at least one Stream and get its token.](/kb/en/logs/quick-start.html#streams)
