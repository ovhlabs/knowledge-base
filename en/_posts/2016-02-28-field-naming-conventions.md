Now that you can send logs, you are maybe wondering how to tell PaaS Logs what kind of data you send. It can be date, or number or boolean or just plain string. At OVH, we love to create fancy dashboards with all these kind of stuff. If you want to be sure that your logs will be properly parsed, this document is made for you !
