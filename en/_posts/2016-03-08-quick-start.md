Welcome to the quick start tutorial of the PaaS Logs. This Quick start guide will help you to understand the core concepts behind the PaaS Logs and how to send your first logs to the engine. 


#1 Welcome to PaaS Logs. <a name="account">&nbsp;</a>

If you have already setup a lab, this procedure should be easy for you. 

 - Log into runabove.com and in the console, activate the Labs by clicking on `more Labs...` and then click on the `PaaS Logs` button.
 - Once Activated a new entry will appear in the navigation sidebar, click on the `PaaS Logs` button there to jump to the main interface.
 - The main interface of PaaS Logs will then appear. 
 - On this page, you have only one action available: `Create user`. You will then have a username in the following form: ra-logs-XXXXX and the password associated. `NOTE THEM CAREFULLY`, theses credentials will be the one you will have to use on `Graylog` and with Kibana later (you will know soon enough how to do it).
