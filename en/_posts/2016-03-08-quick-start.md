Welcome to the quick start tutorial of the PaaS Logs. This Quick start guide will help you to understand the core concepts behind the PaaS Logs and how to send your first logs to the engine. 


#1 Welcome to PaaS Logs. <a name="account">&nbsp;</a>

If you have already setup a lab, this procedure should be easy for you. 

 - Log into runabove.com and in the console, activate the Labs by clicking on `more Labs...` and then click on the `PaaS Logs` button.
 - Once Activated a new entry will appear in the navigation sidebar, click on the `PaaS Logs` button there to jump to the main interface.
 - The main interface of PaaS Logs will then appear. 
 - On this page, you have only one action available: `Create user`. You will then have a username in the following form: ra-logs-XXXXX and the password associated. `NOTE THEM CAREFULLY`, theses credentials will be the one you will have to use on `Graylog` and with Kibana later (you will know soon enough how to do it).

 - Once you have created your credentials, the main interface will appear. 

![Main interface](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/manager_start.png)
 

On this interface you can see 5 items:

1. The `Streams` are the recipient of your logs. When you send a log with the right stream token, it arrives automatically to your stream in a awesome software named Graylog. When you access your stream in Graylog you will be able to search your logs and immediately analyze them. 

2. The `Dashboard` is the global view of your logs, A Dashboard is an efficient way to exploit your logs and to view global information like metrics and trends about your data without being overwhelmed by the logs details.

3. The `Roles` will give you the control over who can read and access your streams or dashboard.

4. The `Inputs` will allow you to ask OVH to host your own dedicated collector like Logstash or Flowgger.

5. The `Aliases` will allow you to access directly your data from your Kibana or using an Elasticsearch query.


#2 Let's send some logs  ! <a name="streams">&nbsp;</a>

 - The first step to do in order to use the PaaS Logs is to create a stream and to get your token. 
To create a stream it is really simple: click on the blue "+" button in the stream panel.  It will ask you for a name and a description for your stream: 

![new Stream](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/newStream.png)

 - Once filled, click on the blue "floppy disk" button and that's it ! You have created your first stream. 
By expanding your stream information, you will see your X-OVH-TOKEN. This key is the only one you will need to address your stream. Under this token, you will have a direct link to your stream in Graylog. 
![stream Created](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/newStream_2.png)

PaaS Logs supports several logs formats, each one of them has its own advantages and weaknesses. Here are the different formats available


 - GELF: This is the native format of logs used by Graylog. This JSON format will allow you to send logs really easily. See: [http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/gelf.html](http://docs.graylog.org/en/latest/pages/gelf.html). The GELF input only accept a nul ('\0') delimiter. 

 - LTSV: this simple format is very efficient and is still human readable. you can learn more about it [here](http://ltsv.org). LTSV has two inputs that accept a line delimiter or a nul delimiter.

 - RFC 5424: This format is one of the most commonly used by logs utility like syslog. It is extensible enough to allow you to send all your data. More information about it can be found at this link: [RFC 5424](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424).

 - Cap'n'Proto: The most efficient log format. this is a binary format that will allows you to maintain a low footprint and high speed performance. If you want to know more about it, check the official website: [Cap'n'Proto](https://capnproto.org/).


Here are the ports you can use on `laas.runabove.com` to send your logs. You can either use the secured ones with SSL Enabled (TLS 1.2) or use the plain unsecured ones if you can't use a SSL transport.

To send your logs to PaaS Logs you can easily test your stream, by doing for example, a simple `echo` or `openssl` command. Here are 3 examples, choose the format you like the most with your preferred terminal. Note that each format has its own timestamp format: GELF uses [seconds from epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), RFC 5424 and LTSV use the [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). Don't forget to change the timestamp to your current time to see your logs (By Default Graylog only display recent logs, you can change the scope of the search by using the top left time picker in the Graylog web interface). Don't forget to change the token to put the right one too.

_GELF_: 

 ```bash
echo -e '{"version":"1.1",  "_X-OVH-TOKEN":"d93eee2a-697f-4bac-a452-705416b98a04", "host": "example.org", "short_message": "A short message that helps you identify what is going on", "full_message": "Backtrace here\n\nmore stuff", "timestamp": 1385053862.3072, "level": 1, "_user_id": 9001, "_some_info": "foo", "some_metric_num": 42.0 }\0' | \
openssl s_client -quiet -no_ign_eof -connect laas.runabove.com:12202
```
For this format, the time is in seconds, with optional milliseconds as decimals. 


 
_LTSV_:

 ```bash
echo -e 'X-OVH-TOKEN:d93eee2a-697f-4bac-a452-705416b98a04\thost:example.org\ttime:2016-03-08T14:44:01+01:00\tmessage:A short message that helps you identify what is going on\tfull_message:Backtrace here\n\nmore stuff\tlevel:1\tuser_id:9001\tsome_info:foo\tsome_metric_num:42.0\0'| \
openssl s_client -quiet -no_ign_eof -connect laas.runabove.com:12200
```

For this format the time is in the RFC 3339 format. 


_RFC 5424_:

 ```bash
echo -e '<6>1 2016-03-08T14:44:01+01:00 149.202.165.20 example.org - - [exampleSDID@8485 X-OVH-TOKEN="d93eee2a-697f-4bac-a452-705416b98a04" user_id="9001"  some_info="foo" some_metric_num="42.0" ] A short message that helps you identify what is going on\n' | \
 openssl s_client -quiet -no_ign_eof -connect laas.runabove.com:6514
```

For this format the time is in the RFC 3339 format. 


 - To see your logs, get back to the Lab Manager and look for the `Graylog access` link just under your token. Click on the link to jump straight to Graylog. You have to use the PaaS Logs credentials that were first given when you have created your user at the first step in the form of `ra-logs-XXXXX/your_password`. If you have not written them, you can click `reset password` in the PaaS Logs Manager (at top right) to obtain a new one. The Graylog login page looks like this:


![login Graylog](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/login.png)


Once logged, you will be redirected to this page: 


![Graylog Stream](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/graylog-stream.png)


On this page you can already search for the different values present in the logs by using the search bar (at the top of the page). You can also select the time range of your search by playing with time picker at the top left of the page. 

For example to search in the Last 5 Minutes, all the logs that contain 42 for the value some\_metric\_num you can enter in the search bar: 

`some_metric_num:42`

Press Enter or click on the Green button to launch the search and wait for your results.

You can also search some part of your message by entering: 
`helps going`. It will give you all the messages that contains the terms 'help' and 'going'.

Graylog allows you to extensively search through your logs without compromising usability. If you want to know more about how to craft relevant searches on Graylog, head to [Graylog Search Documentation](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.0/pages/queries.html).

Send several logs with different value for user\_id for example. At the left of the page you will see the fields present in your stream, you can click on the user\_id checkbox to display all the values for this field along the logs.

#3 Lets create a Dashboard. 

Let's go back to the console of PaaS Logs, we will now create a Dashboard that will allow you to explore your data in a graphical manner. It is even simpler to create a Dashboard, just click on the "+" button and again fill a description and a title for your Dashboard. Once created, you can use the link displayed to access it immediately. 
At first, your dashboard is sad and empty but we will fill it really soon with some awesome widgets ;-). 
To do that get back to your stream: you can use the link on graylog (under the Stream tab) or the link on your console as you wish.
Let's say you want all the user Id for which the value some\_metric is above 30, first. you search for this data: 
  
 - in the search bar, enter this:
 `some_metric_num:>30`
 
 - select above the search bar, the relative range of time you want to use in your widgets. If you want your widget to display the value for the last hour, select "Search in the last Hour".  
 - On the left panel, unroll the user\_id menu (by clicking on the blue triangle at the left) and select Quick Values. It will then display a nice widget with the distribution of the most frequent user\_ids. 
![Quick Values](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/quick-values.png)

This widget gives you the most frequent user\_id in the logs of the last hour that have a some\_metric\_num value above 30. 

- To add this really critical information to your dashboard, click on the "add to Dashboard" menu button and select your freshly created Dashboard. Fill a title for your widget and select the representation of your datas. 

Head to the Dashboard by clicking on the the appropriate tab and observe your widget on it.  
![critical Dashboard](/kb/images/2016-03-08-quick-start/critical-dashboard.png)

Mixing various widgets on the same dashboard give to this feature all its sense. In this screenshot, you can see that we added a widget that represent the mean values for some\_metric\_num (by using generate chart instead of quick values for the field some\_metric in the stream tab). we also updated the title of the first widget using the little "pen" button at the bottom right of the widget and finally we also changed the disposition of the widgets (using the Unlock button at the top right) and moved everything around.
